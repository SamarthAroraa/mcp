# Refactoring Summary

## Problem Identified

The original design had three separate registries:
- `DetectorRegistry` - **Never used** ❌
- `RecommenderRegistry` - **Never used** ❌  
- `AntipatternRegistry` - **Actually used** ✅

This violated YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) and added unnecessary complexity.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Dead Code
- Deleted `src/detectors/detector-registry.ts`
- Deleted `src/recommenders/recommender-registry.ts`

### 2. Made Recommenders Optional
Updated `AntipatternModule` to support two workflows:

```typescript
// Full workflow: Detection + Recommendation
const module = new AntipatternModule(
  new GGDDetector(),
  new GGDRecommender()  // ← Recommender included
);

// Detection-only workflow
const module = new AntipatternModule(
  new GGDDetector()  // ← No recommender
);
```

### 3. Added Fallback Behavior
When no recommender is provided:
- Basic code fixes are automatically generated
- No LLM prompts are included
- Detection still works fully

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Architecture**: One registry instead of three
2. **More Flexible**: Supports detection-only antipatterns
3. **Better Coverage**: Increased from 90.25% to **95.39%**
4. **More Tests**: Added 3 new tests (37 → 40 tests)
5. **Less Code**: Removed ~70 lines of unused code

## API Changes

### AntipatternModule

```typescript
// Before: Recommender required
constructor(
  detector: BaseDetector,
  recommender: BaseRecommender  // ← Required
)

// After: Recommender optional
constructor(
  detector: BaseDetector,
  recommender?: BaseRecommender  // ← Optional
)
```

### New Methods

```typescript
// Check if module has a recommender
module.hasRecommender(): boolean

// Returns undefined if no recommender
module.getPromptInstruction(): string | undefined
```

## Test Results

All tests passing with improved coverage:

```
Test Files  5 passed (5)
     Tests  40 passed (40)
  Coverage  95.39%
```

## Migration Guide

No breaking changes for existing code! The refactoring is backward compatible:

```typescript
// This still works exactly as before
const module = new AntipatternModule(
  new GGDDetector(),
  new GGDRecommender()
);
```

## Files Changed

- ✅ `src/antipatterns/antipattern-module.ts` - Made recommender optional
- ✅ `src/tools/scan-apex-antipatterns-tool.ts` - Handle optional prompts
- ✅ `test/antipatterns/antipattern-module.test.ts` - Added new test cases
- ❌ `src/detectors/detector-registry.ts` - Deleted (unused)
- ❌ `src/recommenders/recommender-registry.ts` - Deleted (unused)
- 📝 `README.md` - Updated documentation

## Design Philosophy

> **"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."**  
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

This refactoring embraces simplicity:
- Removed code that wasn't being used
- Made the design more flexible without adding complexity
- Kept backward compatibility
- Improved test coverage

The result is a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that's easier to understand and extend.
